    <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>Thanks for checking out my website. Although the website is average, I am not. I am an aspiring coder after doing a career change from running my own food truck. I plan to showcase my work and exemplify my awesomness in coding!

      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I live in Grass Valley, CA with my wife, 2 year old and several farm animals. Other than learning to code I also like to number my hobbies in numeric order based on their importance: 
          <ol>
          <li> spend time with my family,</li>
          <li> make stuff, such as carving kitchen utensils and making chef knives,</li>
          <li> do research and development for my new soft drink marketed to programmers, Coda Cola!</li> 
          </ol>
        </p>
